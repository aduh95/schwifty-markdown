### Install locally

First, you have to ensure that these dependencies are installed and available on your path:

* [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/installing.html)
* [Yarn](yarnpkg.com) or [npm](npmjs.com)
* [Node (v8.5+)](nodejs.org)


To begin with, you need to download the dependecies using `yarn` or `npm` :

```shell
yarn install
```

### Run the server

```shell
yarn start path/to/directory/to/listen
```

You can open your browser at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).  
Then, as soon as you save a `.md` file, it will be loaded in your browser.
